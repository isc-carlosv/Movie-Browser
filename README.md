The initial task: Create an Android application to read the top 50 rock songs from the iTunes api and display the artist, song title and price in a table layout, one record per row. 

The application included it's own backend communication stack, logic to retrieve cover images and database to save the data.

The first commit in this repo is a slightly different version from v1.0. Package name was changed, some assets replaced and android target and minSDK updated.
